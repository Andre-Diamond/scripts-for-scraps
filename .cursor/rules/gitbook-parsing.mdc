# Rules for parsing the Gitbook

- All the headings with three hashes are the workgroup names
- All the headings with two hashes are the dates the meeting happened
- All the meetings under a specific date heading happened on that day
- The **facilitator** is the same as the meeting host that is fetched from the supabase database database
- All workgroups have different meeting summary templates
- Please look at the structure of the supabase meeting summary data and you'll notice all summaries have at least one Agenda Item in the object
